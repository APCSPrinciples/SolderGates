Build logic gates with paper circuits 
----------------------------------------------
In this lab you will build three circuits: a basic circuit, an and gate and an or gate. For materials you will need the following:
* card stock (paper)
* copper tape
* button cell battery (e.g. CR2032)
* LED (or buzzer)
* scissors
* binder clip
* solder
* soldering iron

Build a basic circuit
---------------------
The basic circuit will have the following shape with a "tail" to fold over the battery and a gap for the LED.
